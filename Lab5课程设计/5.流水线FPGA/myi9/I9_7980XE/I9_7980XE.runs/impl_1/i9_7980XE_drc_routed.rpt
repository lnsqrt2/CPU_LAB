2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP m_ALU/R0 input A B is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP m_ALU/R0__1 input A B is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#3 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP m_ALU/R0__2 input B is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
Output pipelining  
DSP m_ALU/R0 output P is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 output will improve performance. Both multiplier/adder output can be pipelined.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
Output pipelining  
DSP m_ALU/R0__1 output P is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 output will improve performance. Both multiplier/adder output can be pipelined.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#3 Warning
Output pipelining  
DSP m_ALU/R0__2 output P is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 output will improve performance. Both multiplier/adder output can be pipelined.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net m_CONT/EXT_out_reg[16]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin m_CONT/ext_out_reg[16]_i_2/O, cell m_CONT/ext_out_reg[16]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net m_IDEX/halt_out_reg is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin m_IDEX/halt_reg_i_2/O, cell m_IDEX/halt_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net m_IFID/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin m_IFID/Syscall_reg_i_2/O, cell m_IFID/Syscall_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLIO-7#1 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
An IO Bus in_addr[11:0] with more than one IO standard is found. Components associated with this bus are:  in_addr[11] of IOStandard LVCMOS33; in_addr[10] of IOStandard LVCMOS33; in_addr[9] of IOStandard LVCMOS33; in_addr[8] of IOStandard LVCMOS33; in_addr[7] of IOStandard LVCMOS33; in_addr[6] of IOStandard LVCMOS18; in_addr[5] of IOStandard LVCMOS18; in_addr[4] of IOStandard LVCMOS33; in_addr[3] of IOStandard LVCMOS33; in_addr[2] of IOStandard LVCMOS33; in_addr[1] of IOStandard LVCMOS33; in_addr[0] of IOStandard LVCMOS33;
Related violations: <none>
